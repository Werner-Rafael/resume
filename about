I am starting a Phd in Computer Science.
In Juiz de Fora, Brazil, I graduate in Production Engineering with a three months exchange in Ireland. 
After completing my degree, I studied a MBA in Project Management and a specialization in Educational Alternatives.
In the master degree I developed analytical and programming skills to applay network analysis and graph theory 
to philosophy and sociology of science, ethnography and Digital Humanities.
In my professional experience, I have worked in some companies, with process design and reports for software development; with management of education evaluation projects at national level; with mapping and documentation of organizational processes and with support studies for production planning in the graphic industry.  
I also have walked some steps in entrepreneurship actions. 

Besides of my STEM based trajectory, I do cultivate a meaningful connection with Arts and Humanities.
Originally from Teres√≥polis (Rio de Janeiro), I moved to Juiz de Fora (Minas Gerais) with two years old. 
I love hiking and have been a vegetarian for 20+ years.

I found  a real and meaningful 
long life learning journey 
in the academy and in 
scientific research.
